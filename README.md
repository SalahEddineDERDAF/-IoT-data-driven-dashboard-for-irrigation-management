# IoT-data-driven-dashboard-for-irrigation-management
This project presents the development of a Streamlit-based dashboard for irrigation management, designed to demonstrate how machine learning can support water-efficient farming practices. The dashboard uses datasets collected from IoT sensors (measuring soil moisture, air temperature, and humidity) to simulate real-time decision-making for irrigation.
It allows users to:

üìä Visualize environmental data through dynamic graphs and tables

üåç View parcel locations and irrigation status on an interactive map

ü§ñ Receive irrigation recommendations (pump ON/OFF) powered by a Random Forest Classifier

üìà Analyze trends in soil moisture and weather conditions for better planning

While the dashboard itself is not connected directly to IoT devices, it demonstrates how IoT-collected data can be leveraged to train ML models and inform irrigation strategies, supporting more sustainable agriculture and efficient water use.


For the development and deployment of this dashboard, Google Colab was utilized as the primary platform to run the Streamlit application in a cloud-based environment. The dashboard relies on two key datasets to simulate real-time irrigation decision-making. The first dataset, authored by Kaur et al. (2023), comprises four variables (soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, and motor status) across 3,000 records [Mendeley Data, V1. https://doi.org/10.17632/fpdwmm7nrb.1]. To validate and test the dashboard, a second dataset by Kulkarni (2023), containing the same variables as the first, was employed [Mendeley Data, V1. https://doi.org/10.17632/krsjvfvbsk.1].

# Step 1: Install required libraries
Run these commands in a Colab code cell:

!pip install streamlit -q
!pip install plotly
!pip install folium
!pip install streamlit-autorefresh

# Step 2: Create the dashboard file
In Colab, create a new file called irrigation_dashboard.py.

This file will contain the Streamlit code for the dashboard.

# Step 3: Import the dataset
Upload the training dataset ModelDevDataset.csv into the Colab environment.

This dataset will be used to train and evaluate the ML model.

# Step 4: Add the dashboard code
Copy and paste your dashboard code into irrigation_dashboard.py.

This defines the layout and functionality of the dashboard.

# Step 5: Obtain the public IP address
Run the following command in Colab:

!wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com
‚û°Ô∏è This retrieves the public IP address of your Colab session.

# Step 6: Launch the Streamlit App
Run:
!streamlit run irrigation_dashboard.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
This starts the Streamlit app.

Localtunnel generates a public URL to access the dashboard.

# Step 7: Access the dashboard
Copy the public URL from the Colab output (e.g. https://35.237.141.55:8501) and open it in your browser.

# Step 8: Upload the Test dataset
Upload the testDataset.csv file into Colab.

This dataset simulates real-time IoT sensor data for testing the dashboard.

# Step 9: Close the Dataset import tab
Close the dataset import tab in Streamlit to improve the visualization experience.
