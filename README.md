# IoT-data-driven-dashboard-for-irrigation-management
This project presents the development of a Streamlit-based dashboard for irrigation management, designed to demonstrate how machine learning can support water-efficient farming practices. The dashboard uses datasets collected from IoT sensors (measuring soil moisture, air temperature, and humidity) to simulate real-time decision-making for irrigation.
It allows users to:
📊 Visualize environmental data through dynamic graphs and tables
🌍 View parcel locations and irrigation status on an interactive map
🤖 Receive irrigation recommendations (pump ON/OFF) powered by a Random Forest Classifier
📈 Analyze trends in soil moisture and weather conditions for better planning

While the dashboard itself is not connected directly to IoT devices, it demonstrates how IoT-collected data can be leveraged to train ML models and inform irrigation strategies, supporting more sustainable agriculture and efficient water use.
